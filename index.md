### Connect   
November 2022   

It was a challenge to develop and Deploy Employee engagement app at multiple Geographic locations.    

**What was the approach?**    
Set up Goals and approach towards goals:
Once Goal is set we are ready to start planning to approach the goals   

**Segmentation:**   
Geographic and Demographic segmentation was  first step towards understanding customer pain points and a first step on understanding digitalization goals.

**Targeting:**.   
Understand target audience, target audience being Employees at the lowest organizational hierarchy till highest of organization hierarchy had helped to sort list of features   

**Prioritizing features:**    
AHP was introduced where we prioritized features in a workshop with stakeholders of Broadcom (CIO,Legal,HR,IT head,CTO)    

**Development process:**   
Introduction of scrum for sprint planning and prioritizing of backlog helped in timeline tracking.   

**What was the challenge?**   
Ambiguity of features after demo had added several Change requests till very end of release.   

**How did I face these challenges?**   
Using a simple method “ Cost of delay”. By using technique teams have evaluated cost of doing something later and prioritize the items with highest cost for given timeline.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
