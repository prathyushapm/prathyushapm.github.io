## Connect: Employee Engagement app      
November 2022  
It was a challenge to develop and Deploy Employee engagement app at multiple Geographic locations.    

**What was the approach?**    
Set up Goals and approach towards goals:
Once Goal is set we are ready to start planning to approach the goals   

**Segmentation:**

AHP was introduced where we prioritized features in a workshop with stakeholders of Broadcom (CIO,Legal,HR,IT head,CTO)    

**Development process:**   
Introduction of scrum for sprint planning and prioritizing of backlog helped in timeline tracking.   

**What was the challenge?**   
Ambiguity of features after demo had added several Change requests till very end of release.   

**How did I face these challenges?**   
Using a simple method “ Cost of delay”. By using technique teams have evaluated cost of doing something later and prioritize the items with highest cost for given timeline.
